This repository provides the code for MarkSense, a web application designed to support teachers in mark submission to institute portal.
In this project, I have utilised an extractor model from https://formextractorai.com using an api call to extract the content of the uploading image.
To use this project, you have to train a model in the https://formextractorai.com website and add your extractor id and access token in the app.py file.
